# One-to-one Meetings

Our Line Managers meet frequently with their 'direct reports' for a minimum of 1 hour per month. 

During probation we recommend a 30 minute meeting every week or fortnightly to help a new person on-board successfully into Made Tech. 


## What are 121's used for?
121's are dedicated time for the Line Manager and their 'direct reports' to discuss and cover:
- clarity of their role
- career progression 
- feedback
- mentoring/coaching


## Our 121 tool
We use a tool called Small Improvements to schedule and take notes of all our 121's. These notes become data points that 'direct reports' can use to prepare for annual reviews and promotions.
A scheduled 121 will have a list of 'Talking points' (agenda) that you can setup in advance.
It's also an easy way for 'direct reports' to ask peers for feedback and set objectives for career progression. 


## Line Manager 121 expectations
